# WindCraft

WindCraft is a small tool for visually editing Tailwind CSS classes. It aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to create Tailwind CSS classes without having to remember all the class names or managing the long class names.

## Features

![Flex Layout](docs/images/feature/windcraft-01.gif)

> Tip: Tailwind CSS classes are added to the element as you edit the properties. You can see the classes added in the class attribute of the element.

## Requirements

This extension depends on Tailwind CSS v4.x

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `windcraft.themeFile`: Tailwind CSS theme css file path. *(Defaults to project `main.css` or the Tailwind CSS `theme.css` package file)*

## Known Issues
